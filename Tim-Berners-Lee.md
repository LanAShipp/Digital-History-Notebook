# Tim-Berners-Lee's role in creating the WWW

Naturally gifted in computer programming, and both his parents were working on the Ferranti Mk. I, Tim-Berners-Lee, naturally went to the University of Oxford.
During Tim's time at CERN, he created a program called Enquire that could store information in files that contained connections called links, later becoming hypertext.
later on after his time at Image Computer Systems Ltd., he went back to CERN, where he developed a program that allowed diverse computers to communicate with one another and researchers to control remote machines.
Soon after, he proposed a large hypertext document to be used with the Internet to share all research and findings with other scientists.
He created it, creating a very basic version of what would soon become the World Wide Web.
he then created the World Wide Web with the idea of creating access to any and all information easily.
