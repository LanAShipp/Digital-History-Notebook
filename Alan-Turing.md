### Alan Turing contributions and stuff

He contributed greatly to the creation of computer science and artificial intelligence.
Alan turing was educated at a top private school and later entered the university of cambridge and majored in mathmatics.
In 1936 Turing created a seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the decision problem had a big impact at the emerging science of computing.
Later in his life Mr. Turing created the turing machine a computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer.
Alan and church created a thesis called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine.
this is important because it helps show that no matter how smart a human gets some things are not able to be done by human computers.
as soon as he came back from the war he immediatly started working on designing a computer and his first version would have been better than the early computers like the IBM but was said to be too complicated.
